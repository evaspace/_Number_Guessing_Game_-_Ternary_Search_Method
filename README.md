Hi, I’m Eva2hack (evaspace), CEO of PIERREFEUEXELENCE. This project implements a number guessing game with my custom **ternary search** method — designed to find a secret number between 1 and 1000 using fewer total guesses than classic binary search.

## 🎯 What is this?

The game is simple:  
You think of a number between 1 and 1000, and my program tries to guess it. Instead of classic binary search, I use a two-step guessing strategy that splits the range into thirds and narrows it down faster.

---

## ⚙️ How my method works

- Start with a range `[low, high]` from 1 to 1000.
- Calculate two cut points:  
  `cut1 = low + (high - low) // 3`  
  `cut2 = low + 2 * (high - low) // 3`
- Guess first at `cut1`.
- If your number is greater, guess next at `cut2`.
- Based on your answers, reduce the search range to one of the three parts.
- Repeat until the number is found.

Because I can make up to **two guesses per round**, I get more information quickly and reduce the range more efficiently.

## 📊 Why my method is faster in total guesses than binary search

| Criterion                 | Classic Binary Search          | My Ternary Search Method           |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Interval reduction per round | Half (1/2)                     | Two-thirds (2/3)                  |
| Guesses per round           | 1                             | Up to 2                          |
| Total guesses (worst case)  | ~10 guesses                   | ~8 guesses                      |
| Total guesses (average)     | ~9 guesses                    | ~6 to 7 guesses                  |

## 🔍 Mathematical intuition

- Binary search requires roughly `log₂(n)` guesses (≈10 for 1000 numbers).
- My method uses up to 2 guesses per round but reduces the search space more aggressively.
- With two guesses per round, the effective base of the logarithm changes, and the total guesses become fewer.
- Empirically, my code finds the number in **6–8 guesses on average**, which beats classic binary search in total number of guesses.

## 🚀 Try it yourself!

Run the Python script, think of a number between 1 and 1000, and watch how quickly my method finds it.
